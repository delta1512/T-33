# T-33
A simplistic microprrcessor architecture made from putting my knowledge into practice.

Before using the circuit, be sure to brief yourself on how the processor works. Reading over the Input tables, commands, rules and syntaxes and quickly glancing at the tutorial for using the circuit should provide enough information for usage.
The T-33 is programmed through Logic Circuit, a graphical digital logic editor found at:
http://www.logiccircuit.org/

To begin using the circuit:
- Install the latest version of logic circuit using the link provided
- Download  /T-33/Circuit files/T-33.CircuitProject and open using Logic Circuit
- Double click the circuit on the left bar that says 1. T-33 testing
- Click the power button in the bottom right corner and away you go

Stuff to add:
- More sample programs

Future additions:
- HDL implementation
